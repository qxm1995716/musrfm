Since the github can not upload file > 100 mb, so we can not upload weights file here. Please download the weights file form https://drive.google.com/file/d/16J50fAKbDlvVN2nikLyqHm2BoHXGSLov/view?usp=sharing. <br><br>
You will get a file named model_parameter.pth from the drive and this is the weight parameters we obtained by training on our dataset. The utilize of this can be found in the finetuning.py.
